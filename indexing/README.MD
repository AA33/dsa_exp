Usage
==========================

*Requires Python v2.7.**

The searching feature can be run by:
		
		python query_processor.py

There are a couple of sample csv input files created for testing:

1.  names.csv
2.  names2.csv


*tests.py* has the unit tests I used for testing. They test serialization and deserialization as well apart from searching.
Also, *serilized* has an example serialization.
